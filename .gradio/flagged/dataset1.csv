"How to do it (The Process)
Sign Up: Create an account on OpenRouter or Together AI.
Get API Key: Go to your account settings/dashboard to generate a unique API Key.
Install Library: In your VS Code terminal, install the necessary library:
For OpenRouter (uses OpenAI format): pip install openai.
For Together AI: pip install together.
Set Base URL:
OpenRouter: Set your code's base_url to https://openrouter.ai/api/v1.
Together AI: Use their native SDK or set base_url to https://api.together.xyz.
Choose Model:
On OpenRouter, use the model ID deepseek/deepseek-r1:free.
On Together AI, use deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1.

Recommendation: Since you are just starting your project, start with OpenRouter because they have a completely free version of DeepSeek-R1 that doesn't require a credit card to test. 
Do you want me to provide a simple Python script to connect your summarizer to the OpenRouter free API?

what this error means?
That error means you made a small case-sensitivity mistake. In Python, letters matter!
In Gradio, the class name must start with a capital I. You likely wrote gr.interface, but it must be gr.Interface.
The Fix
Go to line 25 in your text_summerizer.py file and change the lowercase i to an uppercase I:
Wrong:
python
interface = gr.interface(  # lowercase 'i' causes the error
Use code with caution.

Right:
python
interface = gr.Interface(  # uppercase 'I' is correct
Use code with caution.

Why this happened:
In the Gradio library, gr refers to the whole module. gr.interface (lowercase) looks like you're trying to ""call"" the library itself like a function, which Python doesn't allow. gr.Interface (uppercase) tells Python to use the specific Interface tool inside that library. [1][3]
Do you want me to check the input/output parameters of your gr.Interface to make sure the rest of the code will run smoothly?



","'The error occurred because the `gr` module was imported incorrectly as a top-level function instead of using Flask's components directly. Let's go through a step-by-step guide to create the UI correctly.

**Step 1: Import Gradio and Components**

First, import the correct Gradio components:

```python
from gr import Interface
```

**Step 2: Create Your Text Data**

Define your text data for summarization:

```python
text_data = [""The book is a great read. The author wrote an excellent synopsis.""]

# Remove extra whitespace around the text boxes
trimmed_text = [t.strip() for t in text_data]
```

**Step 3: Define Transfer Functions**

Create transfer functions (functions that handle input and output):

```python
def get_summary(text):
    """"""Summary of the given text.""""""
    return ""The book is a great read. The author wrote an excellent synopsis. This summary provides a concise overview of the main points in the book.""

def remove_whitespace(text):
    """"""Remove extra whitespace from each line.""""""
    return [t.strip() for t in text]
```

**Step 4: Create and Run the UI**

Use `gr.Interface` to create your summary interface:

```python
interface = gr.Interface(
    get_summary,
    remove_whitespace,
    name=""Summary Generator""
)

# Display the interface
interface.show()
```

This will create a simple text summarization interface using Gradio. Let me know if you need further assistance!",2026-02-19 08:17:23.182207
